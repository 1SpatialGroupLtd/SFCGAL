# Issue

SFCGAL actualy works with Epeck even if it's not required by algorithms.

# Ongoing refactoring (branch experimental_kernels)

The idea is to extend coordinate storage (```Coordinate::_storage```) to be able to store multiple kernel objects.

* [x] Explicit kernel usage in algorithm
* [x] Remove dangerous constructors (such as Coordinate(double,double)) (because Epick::FT == double)
* [x] Explicit convertion from coordinates to Point_2/Point_3 in order to prepare Epick introduction

Before :

```
Kernel::Point_2 a = point.toPoint_2();
```

After :

```
Kernel::Point_2<Epeck> a = point.toPoint_2<Epeck>();
```

* [x] Change coordinate storage to allow double (Epick) and exact (Epeck) number representation

Before :

```
boost::variant< Empty, Kernel::Point_2, Kernel::Point_3 >
```

After :

```
boost::variant< Empty, Epick::Point_2, Epick::Point_3, Epeck::Point_2, Epeck::Point_3 >
```

# Changes that could break behavior (i.e. regress-test)

* [ ] SLoriot : As missing Z is considered as zero, always store Point_3 and tag "is3D"?

Note : could break some low level unit tests on coordinate?

* [ ] Restore Coordinate/Point constructors from double as deprecated Epick constructors (tests checks that exceptions are thrown)
* [ ] Ensure that Coordinate creation from double creates Epick coordinates


```
boost::variant< Empty, Epick::Point_2, Epick::Point_3, Epeck::Point_2, Epeck::Point_3 >
```

* [ ] Use Epick when possible in algorithm and compare results
    * [ ] Point set triangulation
    * [ ] ...

Lead to questionning on the best way to deal with exact computation in SFCGAL. Should high level function produced clean results "rounded" to a precision model? How to do that?

* [ ] Use approxiate computation when it's possible (length, area, etc. computation) as proposed by Sebastien Loriot

* [ ] Replace Coordinate class by a typedef on ```boost::variant< Empty, Epick::Point_2, Epick::Point_3, Epeck::Point_2, Epeck::Point_3 >``` in order to externalize visitors?



# Perf checks

## Check overhead due to new variant variables

* Before Coordinate variant on Epeck/Epick
